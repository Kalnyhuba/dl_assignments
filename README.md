ASSIGNMENT 1:
We have obtained a dataset from our M1 module, which was a housing dataset from Boston. We tried to predict median value of houses based on different input features. We initialised simple neural network model with 5 different combinations of hyperparameters and tested them on the test sets for loss values.

ASSIGNMENT 2:
For the first part of the assignment we have implemented a semantic search engine with the use of sentence BERT model. Our idea was to recommend a destination in Europe to the user based on the user's preference, which is written as a text query by the user. Our dataset contains some basic information about European countries and some characteristics about them.

For the second part of the assignment, we have implemented gradient descent in one notebook, on a dataset from sci-kit learn library, which is a california housing dataset. We demonstrated loss and calculating gradient and updating weights in the code.

In another notebook we demonstrated attention mechanism. We looked at two similarly constructed sentences with different meanings and visualised the attention matrix on both sentences to show the difference in meaning between the same words in different sentences.
